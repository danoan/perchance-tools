# Getting started with perchance-tools

Collection of tools to write files in the perchance language.

This program contains several scripts to help with the creation
of perchance files. Perchance is a language that facilitates the
generation of natural text in several languages.

The main purpose of this script is to transform a list of words
into perchance data structures. The assumption is that the list of
words was provided from a thesaurus in markdown format.
